# JavaHtmlRenderer
This is an example use of [xhtmlrenderer](https://github.com/flyingsaucerproject/flyingsaucer).

While a lot of materials about the library on the Internet give us information about converting HTML into PDF, information about generating image from HTML is limited.

#### Usage Scenarios

* A client app does not support HTML rendering, but it can render image. Convert the HTML into an image for the client on the server side and send the result.

* There is no way of showing a table on a client, but it can render image. Create the table dynamically in HTML and convert it into image on the server side and send the result.

#### TODO

CSS font spec is ignored.
